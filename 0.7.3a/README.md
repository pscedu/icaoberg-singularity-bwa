## About
Source code repository can be found [here](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/).

## Building the container for Bridges (or similar)
There is no need to build a container, because an image is already available from the Galaxy project, hence all you need to do is run

```
bash ./pull.sh
```

## Installing the container on Bridges (or similar)
Copy the

* `SIF` file
* and the `bwa` script

to `/opt/packages/bwa/0.7.3a`.

Copy the file `modulefile` to `/opt/modules/bwa` as `0.7.3a`.

## Test
To run the available tests, run the command

```
bash ./test.sh
```
